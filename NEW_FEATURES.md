## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints
All data is accessed through a unified FastAPI endpoint:
```
GET /api/live_matches
```

**Parameters:**
- `provider` (optional): Specify data source
  - `pandascore` - PandaScore API
  - `opendota` - OpenDota API
  - `riot_esports` - Riot LoL Esports API
  - `liquipedia` - Liquipedia MediaWiki API
  - (empty) - Aggregated from all sources

**Example URLs:**
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/live_matches` - All sources

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/live_matches?provider=riot_esports` - LoL only

### Data Normalization
All connectors return data in a standardized format:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_match_id",
  "title": "Team A vs Team B",
  "scheduled_time": "2025-01-28T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "live",
  "teams": [
    {
      "name": "Team A",
      "acronym": "TMA",
      "score": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Team B",
      "acronym": "TMB",
      "score": 0
    }
  ],
  "video_game": "League of Legends",
  "game": "League of Legends",
  "provider": "Riot Esports"
}
```

### Caching
- All API responses are cached for 30 seconds
- Reduces API load and improves performance
- Click "↻ Refresh" to get fresh data after cache expires

## 🚀 Testing the Connectors

A test script is included to verify all connectors:
```powershell
